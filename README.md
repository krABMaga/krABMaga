**krABMaga** (Previously named Rust-AB) is a discrete events simulation engine for developing ABM simulation that is written in Rust language. 

krABMaga is designed to be a _ready-to-use_ tool for the ABM community and for this reason the architectural concepts of the well-adopted MASON library were re-engineered to exploit the Rust peculiarities and programming model.

### Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
krabmaga = 0.4.*
```

To get started using krABMaga, see [the examples](https://github.com/krABMaga/examples).
There's also a template to set up the correct project structure and the required files [here](https://github.com/krABMaga/examples/tree/main/template).

**Model Visualization with Bevy Game Engine**

Based on [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/), it's possible to run simulation with visualization. It's also available a menu to start and stop simulations and a slider to set simulation speed.
To run a model with visualization enabled, you have to start the simulation with the command:
```sh
cargo run --release --features  visualization

# Alternative command. Requires 'cargo make' installed
cargo make run --release 
```

In addition to the classical visualization, you can run your krABMaga simulation inside your browser using [*Web Assembly*](https://webassembly.org). 
This is possible with the command:
```sh
# Requires 'cargo make' installed
cargo make serve --release 
```

***Visualization FAQs***

In case you have troubles compiling your visualization, consult this following list of common errors first before making
an issue:
- [Wasm related errors due to `bevy_log`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/3099): run this command to force the `tracing-wasm` dependency to 0.2.0:
```sh
cargo update -p tracing-wasm --precise 0.2.0
```
- "Data remaining" issue or "len is 0 but index is 0" when running a simulation on the web: Force update your wasm-bindgen-cli local installation to version 0.2.79.
- Out of memory error when running a simulation on the web, in chrome: run your simulation with the release profile.

### Dependencies
The visualization framework requires certain dependencies to run the simulation properly.
- :desktop_computer: Windows: [VS2019 build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16)
- :apple: MacOS: No dependencies needed.
- :penguin: Linux: A few dependencies are needed. Check [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/linux_dependencies.md) for a list based on your distribution.

### How to write your first model

If you don't start from our [Template](https://github.com/krABMaga/examples/tree/main/template), add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
krabmaga = 0.4.*

[features]
visualization = ["krabmaga/visualization"]
visualization_wasm = ["krabmaga/visualization_wasm"]
```

We **strongly** recommend to use [Template](https://github.com/krABMaga/examples/tree/main/template) or any other example as base of a new project, especially if you want to provide any visualization.

Each krABMaga model needs structs that implements our *Traits*, one for *State* and the other for *Agent*. In the *State* struct you have to put *Agent* field(s), because it represents the ecosystem of a simulation. More details for each krABMaga componenet are in the [Architecture](#architecture) section.

The simplest part is `main.rs`, because is similar for each example.
You can define two *main* functions using **cfg** directive, that can remove code based on which features are (not) enabled.  
Without visualization, you have only to use *simulate!* to run simulation, passing a state, step number and how may time repeat your simulation. 
With visualization, you have to set graphical settings (like dimension or background) and call *start* method.
```rs
// Main used when only the simulation should run, without any visualization.
#[cfg(not(any(feature = "visualization", feature = "visualization_wasm")))]
fn main() {
  let dim = (200., 200.);
  let num_agents = 100;  
  let state = Flocker::new(dim, num_agents);
  let step = 10;
  let reps = 1;
  let _ = simulate!(state, step, reps);
}

// Main used when a visualization feature is applied.
#[cfg(any(feature = "visualization", feature = "visualization_wasm"))]
fn main() {
  let dim = (200., 200.);
  let num_agents = 100;
  let state = Flocker::new(dim, num_agents);
  Visualization::default()
      .with_window_dimensions(1000., 700.)
      .with_simulation_dimensions(dim.0 as f32, dim.1 as f32)
      .with_background_color(Color::rgb(0., 0., 0.))
      .with_name("Flockers")
      .start::<VisState, Flocker>(VisState, state);
}

```

### Available features

| Compilation Feature  | Description |  Experimental | Release Candidate  | Stable  |
|:----:|:---------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **No Features** | Possibility to run model using `Simulation Terminal` and setup model-exploration experiments (Parameter Sweeping, Genetic and Random) in sequential/parallel mode. It's enough to create your base simulations. |   |   | ü¶Ä |
| **visualization**  | Based on `Bevy engine`, it makes possible to visualize your model elements, to understand better the behavior of your simulation. |   | ü¶Ä |   |
| **visualization-wasm** | Based on `Web Assembly`, give you the possibility to execute your visualized simulation inside your own browser. |   | ü¶Ä |   |
| **distributed-mpi** | Enable distributed model exploration using MPI. At each iteration, the amount of configurations are balanced among your nodes.  |   |  ü¶Ä |   |
| **bayesian**  | Use ML Rust libraries to use/create function to use `Bayesian Optimization`.|   | ü¶Ä  |   |
| **parallel**  | Speed-up a single simulation parallelizing agent scheduling during a step.| ü¶Ä  |   |   |

### Macros for playing with Simulation Terminal

`Simulation Terminal` is enabled by default using macro `simulate!`, so can be used passing a state, step number and how may time repeat your simulation..
That macro has a fourth optional parameter, a boolean. When `false` is passed, `Simulation Terminal` is disabled.
```rs
($s:expr, $step:expr, $reps:expr $(, $flag:expr)?) => {{
      // Macro code 
}}
```

You can create tabs and plot your data using two macro:
- `addplot!` let you create a new plot that will be displayed in its own tab.
```rs
addplot!(String::from("Chart Name"), String::from("xxxx"), String::from("yyyyy"));
```
- `plot!` to add a point to a plot. Points can be added during simulation execution, for example inside `after_step` method.
  You have to pass plot name, series name, x value and y value. Coordinate values need to be `f64`.
```rs
plot!(String::from("Chart name"), String::from("s1"), x, y);
```

On Terminal home page there is also a *log section*, you can plot log messages when some event needs to be noticed.
You can navigate among all logs using ‚Üë‚Üì arrows.
To add a log use the macro `log!`, passing a `LogType` (an enum) and the log message.
```rs
 log!(LogType::Info, String::from("Log Message"));
```

Are available four type of Logs:
```rs
pub enum LogType {
    Info,
    Warning,
    Error,
    Critical,
}
```
