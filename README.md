**Rust-AB** is a discrete events simulation engine for developing ABM simulation that is written in Rust language. 

Rust-AB is designed to be a _ready-to-use_ tool for the ABM community and for this reason the architectural concepts of the well-adopted MASON library were re-engineered to exploit the Rust peculiarities and programming model.

:zap:  The actual community effort on Rust-AB is mainly devoted to supporting **Parallel** execution and model **Visualization** using the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/).

### Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rust-ab = { git="https://github.com/rust-ab/rust-ab.git" }
```

To get started using Rust-AB, see [the examples](https://github.com/rust-ab/rust-ab-examples).
There's also a template to set up the correct project structure and the required files [here](https://github.com/rust-ab/rust-ab-examples/tree/main/template).

**Parallel execution**

Parallel execution can be achieved by passing the `parallel` feature when running a simulation and specifying the number of threads to use:

```cargo run --release --features parallel -- --nt 4```
- ```-- --nt X``` where ```X``` is the number of threads used by the parallel execution.

**Model Visualization with Bevy Game Engine**

Rust-AB exploits the [Bevy Game Engine](https://bevyengine.org/) to support model visualization.

```sh
cargo run --release --example --features="visualization"
```

***Visualization FAQs***

In case you have troubles compiling your visualization, consult this following list of common errors first before making
an issue:
- [Wasm related errors due to `bevy_log`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/3099): run this command to force the `tracing-wasm` dependency to 0.2.0:
```sh
cargo update -p tracing-wasm --precise 0.2.0
```
- "Data remaining" issue or "len is 0 but index is 0" when running a simulation on the web: Force update your wasm-bindgen-cli local installation to version 0.2.79.
- Out of memory error when running a simulation on the web, in chrome: run your simulation with the release profile.

### Dependencies
The visualization framework requires certain dependencies to run the simulation properly.
- :desktop_computer: Windows: [VS2019 build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16)
- :apple: MacOS: No dependencies needed.
- :penguin: Linux: A few dependencies are needed. Check [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/linux_dependencies.md) for a list based on your distribution.

## Boids Simulation Example

The Boids model by C. Raynolds, 1986, is a steering behavior ABM for autonomous agents, which simulates the flocking behavior of birds. The agent behavior is derived by a linear combination of three independent rules: _Separation_: steer in order to avoid crowding local flockmates; _Alignment_: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates; _Cohesion_: steer to move towards the average location (center of mass) of local flockmates.

- Single core execution: ```cargo run --release --example boids```
- Multiple core execution: ```cargo run --release --example boids --features parallel -- --nt 4```

## Boids Simulation Example

The Boids model by C. Raynolds, 1986, is a steering behavior ABM for autonomous agents, which simulates the flocking behavior of birds. The agent behavior is derived by a linear combination of three independent rules: _Separation_: steer in order to avoid crowding local flockmates; _Alignment_: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates; _Cohesion_: steer to move towards the average location (center of mass) of local flockmates.


### Agent definition

A Rust-AB agent is a struct contains all the local agent data. For our exampel, we have to define a new struct named _Bird_ that emulate the concept of a bird in a flock. The struct definition, in Rust-AB, must implements the trait  _Agent_ and the traits _Eq_ and _Hash_. According to the model specification, each agent in each simulation time has to compute three steering rules according to its neighboring agents. For this reason, it will be placed in a Rust-AB _Field2D_, a bi-dimensional environment. Consequentially, the agent definition must implements the trait _Location2D_, and also the traits _Clone_ and _Copy_, instead of developing they can be automatically computed using the Rust macro ```#derive[(\_)]```.

The steering behavior model can be developed by storing the location of the agent in the previous time and in current time, the agent location can be modeled using a Rust-AB struct named _Real2D_. Furthermore, an unique identify is stored in the agent in order to easily develop the trait _Hash_. 

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
pub struct Bird{
    pub id: u128,
    pub loc: Real2D,
    pub last_d: Real2D,
}
```

The agent logic is placed in the _step_ function, however, in order to develop more robust code, we designed agent logic using three sub-functions defined in the agent implementation. Listing _code2_ shows the agent implementation code. Lines 1-8 defines the object _Bird_, by providing the object constructor, and three functions: avoidance, cohesion, and consistency, corresponding to the steering model rules. Each function takes as input parameter the reference to a vector of agents (the agent neighborhood) and returns a new Real2D, which is the force computed according to the neighbors. Moreover, lines 9-12 shows the code for implementing the trait _Location2D_ trait, which enables to place the agent in the _Field2D_ environment. Lines 13-20 shows the code for implementing the Rust traits _Hash_ and _Eq_, notice that in order to develop the Rust _Eq_ trait, it is needed to develop also the trait _PartialEq_, which is developed by exploiting the unique agent identifier.

Finally, the agent _step_ function is defined. Lines 21-39 shows the code of the agent logic, that enables to simulate the steering behavior of the model. The agent computes the neighboring agents (line 23) and using the sub-functions compute its new location. The computed location is used to update the status of the environment (line 37). Notice that in order to access to the simulation state, are used a particular Rust mechanism.

```rust
impl Bird {
    pub fn new(id: u128, loc: Real2D, last_d: Real2D) -> Self {
        Bird {id, loc, last_d}
    }
    pub fn avoidance (self, _vec: &Vec<Bird>) -> Real2D {..}
    pub fn cohesion (self, _vec: &Vec<Bird>) -> Real2D {..}
    pub fn consistency (self, _vec: &Vec<Bird>) -> Real2D {..}
 }
impl Location2D<Real2D> for Bird {
    fn get_location(self) -> Real2D { self.loc }
    fn set_location(&mut self, loc: Real2D) { self.loc = loc; }
}
impl Hash for Bird {
    fn hash<H>(&self, state: &mut H) where H: Hasher,
    { state.write_u128(self.id); state.finish();}
}
impl Eq for Bird {}
impl PartialEq for Bird {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Bird) -> bool {self.id == other.id}
}
impl Agent for Bird {
    fn step(&mut self) {
        let vec = GLOBAL_STATE.lock().unwrap().field1.get_neighbors_within_distance(self.loc,10.0);
        let avoid = self.avoidance(&vec);
        let cohe  = self.cohesion(&vec);
        let rand  = self.randomness();
        let cons  = self.consistency(&vec);
        let mom   = self.last_d;
        let mut dx = COHESION*cohe.x + AVOIDANCE*avoid.x + CONSISTENCY*cons.x + RANDOMNESS*rand.x + MOMENTUM*mom.x;
        let mut dy = COHESION*cohe.y + AVOIDANCE*avoid.y + CONSISTENCY*cons.y + RANDOMNESS*rand.y + MOMENTUM*mom.y;
        let dis = (dx*dx + dy*dy).sqrt();
        if dis > 0.0 { dx = dx/dis*JUMP; dy = dy/dis*JUMP;}
        let _lastd = Real2D {x: dx, y:dy};
        let loc_x = toroidal_transform(self.loc.x + dx, WIDTH);
        let loc_y = toroidal_transform(self.loc.y + dy, HEIGHT);
        self.loc = Real2D{x: loc_x, y: loc_y};
        GLOBAL_STATE.lock().unwrap().field1.set_object_location(*self, Real2D{x: loc_x, y: loc_y});
    }
}
```

### Model definition

Rust-AB simulation comprises several fields definitions and state variables, that must be placed in a struct (the simulation state). We define the Boids simulation state by declaring a new struct named _State_. 

According to the model and the agent definition, we designed the agents interactions using the _Field2D_ environment, for this reason the state struct contains only a _Field2D_ declaration. Moreover, the Rust memory model does not allow the programmer to share data across several functions invocations. To access the simulation state inside the agent _step_ function, we have to declare the _State_ instance as a global variable, and exploit a semaphore (or mutex) to safely read it. Notice that  the _State_ struct  needs to be  initialized at running time using the macro ```lazy_static!``` (line 8-10).

```rust
pub struct State{
    pub field1: Field2D<Bird>,
}
impl State {
    pub fn new(w: f64, h: f64, d: f64, t: bool) -> State { State {field1: Field2D::new(w, h, d, t),}}
}
//Global variables definition
lazy_static! {
    static  ref GLOBAL_STATE: Mutex<State> = Mutex::new(State::new(WIDTH, HEIGTH, DISCRETIZATION, TOROIDAL));
}
```


Finally, the  main simulation function is defined. At line 2 a new Rust-AB _Schedule_ is defined, while from line 3 to 11 are randomly initialized a number of agents, placed in the _Field2D_ (line 9), and scheduled using the _schedule_repeating_ method (line 10). At line 12 the schedule step is called for a certain number of times.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut schedule: Schedule<Bird> = Schedule::new();
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    for bird_id in 0..NUM_AGENT{
        let r1: f64 = rng.gen();
        let r2: f64 = rng.gen();
        let last_d = Real2D {x: 0.0, y: 0.0};
        let bird = Bird::new(bird_id, Real2D{x: WIDTH*r1, y: HEIGTH*r2},last_d);
        GLOBAL_STATE.lock().unwrap().field1.set_object_location(bird,bird.loc);
        schedule.schedule_repeating(bird,0.0,0);
    }
    for _ in 1..STEP{ schedule.step(); }
}
```
